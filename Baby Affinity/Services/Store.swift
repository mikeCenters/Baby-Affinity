// MARK: - Premium Account Wrapper

/**
 A property wrapper that tracks whether the user has a Premium account.
 
 This wrapper monitors the `Store` environment object to check if the user has purchased the premium account. It automatically updates its internal state based on the `purchasedProductIDs` in the `Store`. Manual updates to this wrapper are prevented.
 
 Usage:
 ```swift
 @PremiumAccount private var isPremium: Bool
 ```
 The wrappedValue provides read-only access to the premium status, while the projectedValue provides a binding to isPremium, but without allowing external modification.
 
 - Important: This property wrapper should not be manually set outside of its intended use. An attempt to do so will log an error.
 - Important: This property wrapper uses the `Store` within the environment to manage state changes.

// MARK: - Store
/**
 A singleton class that manages interactions with the App Store, including product fetching, purchasing, and restoring purchases.
 
 The `Store` class is responsible for maintaining the state of purchased products, handling purchase transactions, and synchronizing entitlements. It provides methods to fetch available products, initiate purchases, and restore previous purchases. It also handles transaction updates and maintains the state of the premium product.
 
 Usage:
 ```swift
 Store.shared.fetchProducts()
 Store.shared.purchase(product)
 Store.shared.restorePurchases()
 ```
 - Note: The class is annotated with @MainActor to ensure that all its methods are run on the main thread.
 - Important: The class has a debugging instance `Store.premium` for use within debugging that unlocks all content.

 Properties
 - products: A published array of Product objects available for purchase.
 - purchasedProductIDs: A published set of product IDs representing the userâ€™s purchased products.
 
 Initialization
 
 The Store class is initialized with an optional isPremium parameter for debugging purposes, allowing the content to be unlocked during development. The shared static property provides a singleton instance of the Store.
 
 Methods
 - fetchProducts(): Asynchronously fetches the available products from the App Store.
 - purchase(_:): Asynchronously handles the purchase process for a given product.
 - restorePurchases(): Asynchronously restores previously purchased products.
 - monitorTransactionUpdates(): Monitors and handles updates to transactions, including purchases and refunds.
 - syncPurchasedProducts(): Synchronizes the list of purchased products based on current entitlements.
 - handlePurchaseVerification(_:): Handles the verification of a purchase transaction.
 - handleTransaction(_:): Processes a transaction, updating the list of purchased product IDs and finishing the transaction.
 
 Debugging Methods
 - unlockContent(): Adds the premium product ID to the set of purchased product IDs for debugging purposes.
